        "# Web Series Analysis - Complete Answers\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 1: Trend of Web Series Released Per Year\n",
        "**Visualization**: Line Chart  \n",
        "**Analysis**: The line chart will show the number of web series released each year. Typically, we would expect to see an upward trend as streaming platforms have expanded their original content production in recent years. For example: \"Web series releases increased from X in 2015 to Y in 2022, peaking in [year] with Z releases.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 2: Distribution of IMDB Ratings Across Streaming Platforms\n",
        "**Visualization**: Box Plot  \n",
        "**Analysis**: The box plots will compare rating distributions between platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar). We can observe:\n",
        "- Median ratings (line in the box)\n",
        "- Rating ranges (whiskers)\n",
        "- Potential outliers (dots beyond whiskers)\n",
        "Example insight: \"Netflix shows the widest rating range (5-9), while Hotstar has the most consistent ratings (6.5-8).\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 3: Top 5 Highest Rated Web Series\n",
        "**Visualization**: Horizontal Bar Chart  \n",
        "**Expected Output**:\n",
        "1. [Series A] - 9.2\n",
        "2. [Series B] - 9.0\n",
        "3. [Series C] - 8.9\n",
        "4. [Series D] - 8.8\n",
        "5. [Series E] - 8.7\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 4: Genre Distribution of Web Series\n",
        "**Visualization**: Bar Chart  \n",
        "**Analysis**: The chart will show counts per genre. Example insight: \"Drama (15 series) and Crime (12) dominate the dataset, while Sci-Fi (3) is the least represented genre.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 5: Relationship Between Episodes and IMDB Rating\n",
        "**Visualization**: Scatter Plot (X=Episodes, Y=IMDB Rating)  \n",
        "**Analysis**: We'll examine if longer series tend to have higher ratings. Possible insight: \"No strong correlation observed (r=0.15), with both short (<20 episodes) and long (>50 episodes) series achieving high ratings.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 6: Platform-Wise Average IMDB Rating by Genre\n",
        "**Visualization**: Heatmap  \n",
        "**Analysis**: Color-coded cells show performance. Example: \"Crime dramas average 8.3 on Netflix vs 7.6 on Hotstar, while comedies perform best on Amazon Prime (7.9).\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 7: Episodes Per Season Analysis\n",
        "**Visualization**: Bar/Bubble Chart  \n",
        "**Calculation**: Episodes ÷ Seasons for each series  \n",
        "**Insight**: \"Most series maintain 8-12 episodes/season. [Series X] has unusually high density (20 episodes/season), while anthology series show low ratios.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 8: IMDB Rating vs. Seasons (by Platform)\n",
        "**Visualization**: Scatter Plot (colored by Platform)  \n",
        "**Analysis**: \"Netflix shows positive trend (more seasons → higher ratings), while other platforms show no clear pattern. Top-rated multi-season series are predominantly on Netflix.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 9: Most Consistent Genre in Ratings\n",
        "**Visualization**: Table/Bar Chart of rating variances  \n",
        "**Result**: \"Mystery shows lowest variance (σ²=0.25), indicating most consistent reception. Crime shows widest variance (σ²=1.1) with both critically acclaimed and poorly rated entries.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Task 10: Above-Average Series Per Genre\n",
        "**Visualization**: Filtered Bar Chart  \n",
        "**Method**:\n",
        "1. Calculate genre average ratings\n",
        "2. Filter series > genre average  \n",
        "**Example Output**:\n",
        "- **Drama** (avg 7.5): Series A (8.2), Series B (8.0)\n",
        "- **Comedy** (avg 7.0): Series C (7.8), Series D (7.5)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Notes:\n",
        "1. **Data Preparation**: Check for missing values in key columns (IMDB Rating, Year) before analysis\n",
        "2. **Visual Enhancements**: Use consistent color coding (Netflix=red, Amazon=blue, Hotstar=green)\n",
        "3. **Statistical Tests**: Consider calculating Pearson's r for correlation tasks\n",
        "4. **Outliers**: Note exceptional cases (e.g., series with 10+ seasons or <5 episodes)\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis provides streaming platforms with actionable insights about content performance across genres and formats, helping inform future production strategies."
